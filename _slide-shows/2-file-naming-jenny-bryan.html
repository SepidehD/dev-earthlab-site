## What works, what doesn't?

## Three principles for (file) names

1. Machine readable
2. Human readable
3. Plays well with default ordering

---

## Good File Names

![awesome_names](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/awesome_names.png)

---

## Machine readable names

Regular expression and globbing friendly
* Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity

Easy to compute on
* Deliberate use of delimiters

---

## Globbing - Shell

.one-half[
**Complete file list:**
![plasmid_names](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/plasmid_names.png)
]

.one-half[
**Narrow file list:**
![plasmid_names](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/plasmid_glob.png)
]

## Subset With Mac OS Finder Search

---
## Subset using R - regex

![plasmid_regex](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/plasmid_regex.png)

---

## Punctuation

Deliberate use of `"-"` and `"_"` allows recovery of meta-data from the filenames:

- `"_"` underscore used to delimit units of meta-data I want later
- `"-"` hyphen used to delimit words so my eyes don't bleed

## Punctuation

Deliberate use of `"-"` and `"_"` allows recovery of meta-data from the filenames:

This happens to be R but also possible in the shell, Python, etc.

## Recap: machine readable

- Easy to search for files later

- Easy to narrow file lists based on names

- Easy to extract info from file names, e.g. by splitting

- New to regular expressions and globbing? be kind to yourself and avoid
    + Spaces in file names
    + Punctuation
    + Accented characters
    + Different files named `foo` and `Foo`

# Human readable

## Human readable

- Name contains info on content

- Connects to concept of a *slug* from semantic URLs

## Example

**Which set of file(name)s do you want at 3 a.m. before a deadline?**

![human_readable_not_options](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/human_readable_not_options.png)

## Embrace the slug

<div class="columns-2">
![slug_filenames](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/slug_filenames.png)
![slug](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/slug.jpg)
</div>

## Recap: Human readable

Easy to figure out what the heck something is, based on its name

# Plays well with default ordering

## Plays well with default ordering

- Put something numeric first

- Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates

- Left pad other numbers with zeros

## Examples

**Chronological order:**

![chronological_order](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/chronological_order.png)

<hr>

**Logical order:** Put something numeric first

![logical_order](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/logical_order.png)

## Dates

Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates: YYYY-MM-DD

![chronological_order](/images/slide-shows/intro-file-naming/chronological_order.png)

## Left pad other numbers with zeros

If you don’t left pad, you get this:

10_final-figs-for-publication.R
1_data-cleaning.R
2_fit-model.R
~~~

which is just sad :(

## Recap: Plays well with default ordering

- Put something numeric first

- Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates

- Left pad other numbers with zeros

## Recap

## Three principles for (file) names

1. Machine readable

2. Human readable

3. Plays well with default ordering

## Pros

- Easy to implement NOW

- Payoffs accumulate as your skills evolve and projects get more complex

## Go forth and use awesome file names :)
