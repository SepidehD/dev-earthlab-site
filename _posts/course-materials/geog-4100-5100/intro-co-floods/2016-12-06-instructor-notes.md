Georeferenced imagery, collected using satellites and airplanes can provide a powerful
visual record of landscape changes. Google Earth, has a time series feature that
allows you to look at imagery of the earth, across time. Let's have a look at some
of the visible changes.


## STEPS HERE ABOUT HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND VIEW TIME SERIES IN GOOGLE EARTH

1. Download & Install Google Earth
2. Open Google Earth
3. Download the KML file for significant damage.
4. Click on the show historical imagery button in google earth <screen shot of nav bar>
5. Scroll to 10/2012 and the 10/2013. Do you see differences?

* have them take the kml and open it in google earth. it should open when you double click
* have them look at before and after images using the time slider.
* we will need explicit instructions on how to use the time slider.

## Activity: What Changes do you see?

As a group, discuss the following questions. Record your answers following the
directions of your instructor (Google Doc, word document, etherpad, etc.).

* What differences to you see between 2012 and 2013?
  * For each difference: What you think caused that difference?
  * For each difference: How can you quantitatively record the differences?
* For each CAUSE listed above, could you somehow quantitatively record the "size" or impact of the cause?
* Was the cause - caused by something else? IE did something else DRIVE the cause?
* Create a diagram that illustrates the causes and effects (or drivers and impacts) of the flood. Is it a linear diagram? Is it quantifiable?
