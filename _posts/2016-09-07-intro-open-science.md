## The Scenario

You are in a lab and a colleague has moved on to a new job and left you their
research which you are tasked by your supervisor with picking up and moving forward.
Have a look at the files that were left for you to work with and answer the following
questions:

1. Are the contents of the directory easy to understand?
2. Do you feel confident that you can easily recreate the workflow associated with the data / code?
3. Do you have access to the data? What data are available and where / how were
they collected?
