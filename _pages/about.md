This site hosts resources developed by the Earth Lab team at University of Colorado,
Boulder. This website contains data, code tutorials, course materials and blog
posts related to our work. Most of the tutorials are aimed at building `R` and
`Python` skills relevant to working with Earth analytics, including geospatial,
social, biological, and earth systems data. The course materials will focus on
a suite of topics including:

* geospatial analysis
* open, reproducible Science
* spatio temporal data
* heterogeneous data structures
* remote sensing



## Our Team

Our mission is to both capitalize on the data deluge from Space and other
platforms to accelerate science and to train a new generation of data scientists
who can apply their knowledge to addressing outstanding Earth Science questions.
Our team approaches Earth analytics from a diverse set of perspectives, with
backgrounds in high performance computing, statistics, visualization, and
applied science.
